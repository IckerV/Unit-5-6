    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>Monkey D. Luffy grew up in Foosha Village, idolizing the pirate Shanks. After eating the Gum-Gum Fruit, he gained the ability to stretch like rubber but lost the ability to swim. Inspired by Shanksâ€™ sacrifice to save him, Luffy set off to become Pirate King and find the legendary treasure, the One Piece.</p>
